## 🚀 How to Use This Project

### Step 1: Read the Exercise
Navigate to `exercises/` and read the exercise description. Each exercise includes:
- **Objective**: What you'll learn
- **Requirements**: What the script should do
- **Constraints**: Limitations and edge cases
- **Example**: Sample input/output
- **Hints**: Tips to get started

### Step 2: Practice with AI Pair Programming
1. Open the exercise file in your editor
2. Start a conversation with your AI assistant (like me!)
3. Ask questions like:
   - "How do I approach this problem?"
   - "What's the best way to handle this edge case?"
   - "Can you explain this bash concept?"
   - "Help me debug this error"
4. Write code iteratively, getting feedback as you go

### Step 3: Test Your Solution
- Run your script with test data
- Check edge cases
- Verify error handling
- Compare with reference solution (if stuck)

### Step 4: Review and Refactor
- Review the solution in `solutions/`
- Refactor your code for better practices
- Document your learnings

## 📋 Exercise Categories

### 01-Basics (10 exercises)
Fundamental shell scripting concepts

### 02-Intermediate (10 exercises)
Text processing, file operations, error handling

### 03-Advanced DevOps (15 exercises)

## 🎓 AI Pair Programming Tips

1. **Start with questions**: Ask "How do I..." before asking for code
2. **Explain your approach**: Share your thinking process
3. **Iterate**: Build incrementally, test frequently
4. **Learn from errors**: Ask AI to explain error messages
5. **Request explanations**: "Why does this work?" or "What's a better way?"
6. **Practice debugging**: Share error output and ask for help

## ✅ Progress Tracking
