## 🤖 AI Pair Programming Best Practices

### Effective Prompts

**For Learning Concepts**:
```
"I need to understand how [concept] works in bash. Can you explain with examples?"
"What's the difference between [option A] and [option B]?"
```

**For Problem Solving**:
```
"I'm trying to [goal]. I've thought about [approach]. Does this make sense?"
"I need to handle [scenario]. What's the best practice?"
```

**For Debugging**:
```
"I'm getting this error: [error]. What does it mean?"
"My script runs but produces unexpected output. Can you help debug?"
```

**For Improvement**:
```
"This works, but how can I make it more robust?"
"Is this the right way to handle errors in production?"
```

### What to Avoid

❌ "Write me a complete script for X"
✅ "I need to do X. What's the best approach?"

❌ Copy-pasting without understanding
✅ Typing code yourself and asking questions

❌ Moving on when something works but you don't understand why
✅ Asking "why" and "how" until you understand
