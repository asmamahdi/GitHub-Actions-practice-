# Exercise 4.3: Security Incident Response Automation

## Objective
Automate response to security incidents: detection, containment, and remediation.

## Scenario
A security breach is detected. You need to:
1. Detect and classify the threat
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Collect forensic data
4. Patch vulnerabilities
5. Restore services safely
6. Generate incident report

## Requirements
- Threat detection and classification
- Automated containment
- Forensic data collection
- Vulnerability patching
- Safe service restoration
- Compliance reporting
- Post-incident analysis

## Example Output
```
