# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project
```bash
cd shell-scripting-practice
```

### Step 2: Choose Your First Exercise
Start with the basics:
```bash
# Read the exercise
cat exercises/01-basics/exercise-01-hello-world.md
```

### Step 3: Create Your Script
```bash
# Create a new script file
touch exercises/01-basics/my-hello-world.sh
chmod +x exercises/01-basics/my-hello-world.sh
```

### Step 4: Start AI Pair Programming
Open your script in your editor and start a conversation with your AI assistant:

**Good first question:**
> "I'm learning shell scripting. I need to write a script that displays 'Hello, [Name]!' with the current date. How do I get started?"

### Step 5: Build Incrementally
1. Start with the shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
2. Add a variable for your name
3. Add the date command
4. Test as you go: `./my-hello-world.sh`

### Step 6: Compare and Learn
After you've written your solution:
```bash
# Compare with reference solution
cat solutions/01-basics/exercise-01-hello-world.sh
```

## 📋 Daily Practice Workflow

### Morning (30 min)
1. **Pick an exercise** from the current week
2. **Read the requirements** carefully
3. **Ask AI** about concepts you don't understand
4. **Start coding** with AI guidance

### Evening (30 min)
1. **Complete the exercise**
2. **Test thoroughly**
3. **Compare with solution**
4. **Refactor** based on what you learned

## 🎯 Your First Week Plan

**Day 1**: Exercise 1.1 - Hello World
- Learn: Variables, echo, date command
- Time: 30-45 minutes

**Day 2**: Exercise 1.2 - User Input
- Learn: read command, validation
- Time: 45-60 minutes

**Day 3**: Exercise 1.3 - File Operations
- Learn: File checks, file info
- Time: 45-60 minutes

**Day 4**: Exercise 1.4 - Loops
- Learn: for loops, while loops
- Time: 60 minutes

**Day 5**: Exercise 1.5 - Functions
- Learn: Function syntax, parameters
- Time: 60 minutes

**Day 6-7**: Review and practice
- Revisit exercises 1.1-1.5
- Build a small project combining concepts

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't skip the basics** - They're the foundation
2. **Type code yourself** - Don't just copy-paste
3. **Ask "why"** - Understand, don't just make it work
4. **Test edge cases** - What if input is empty? Invalid?
5. **Read error messages** - They tell you what's wrong

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Stuck on a Concept?
Ask AI: "I don't understand how [concept] works. Can you explain with examples?"

### Code Not Working?
Ask AI: "I'm getting this error: [paste error]. What does it mean?"

### Need a Better Approach?
Ask AI: "This works, but is there a better way to do this?"

### Want to Understand Best Practices?
Ask AI: "How would a senior DevOps engineer write this script?"

## ✅ Success Checklist

After each exercise, you should be able to:
- [ ] Explain what the script does
- [ ] Understand each line of code
- [ ] Modify it to do something similar
- [ ] Handle errors properly
- [ ] Write it again without looking at the solution

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Complete Week 1 exercises** (1.1 - 1.10)
2. **Review the Implementation Plan** (`IMPLEMENTICE_PLAN.md`)
3. **Set up your practice schedule**
4. **Start building your portfolio**
